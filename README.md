# Code Quiz

## Description

A code quiz using JavaScript skills learned in the UW Code Camp that saves highscores. Coding concepts such as variables, loops, functions, and objects were combined with JavaScript's event listeners and local storage to create a functioning application that tests your knowledge on JavaScript! Creating this application has helped create a deeper understanding of how Javascript can be used in combination with HTML and CSS to produce interactive and dynamic webpages.

## Usage

Take and quiz and test your knowledge! The questions are JavaScript based and you will earn points for each correct answer. But be careful! Wrong answers will deduct points and seconds from your timer. Save your highscore at the end and challenge your friends to do better! This quiz is also a great resource for new developers and students to see how JavaScript, HTML, and CSS function together to create a dynamic website. The code has been commented to explain functionality. This application uses local storage to save your scores. You can view this in the Chrome DevTools Console by clicking "Application" and "local storage".
